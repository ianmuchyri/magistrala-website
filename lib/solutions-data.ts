This pack connects your field sensors and actuators to a single platform, catches problems within seconds of threshold breach, and files your weekly soil health and water efficiency reports automatically.",
    description:
      "The Smart Irrigation pack gives farms and managed landscapes a live view of soil conditions, water flow, and tank levels across multiple field zones. Soil moisture sensors, weather stations, flow meters, smart valves, and a pump controller all land in pre-built dashboards with detection rules and scheduled reports already wired up. When soil moisture drops below the wilting threshold at 3 AM, the alarm fires and the email goes out before the crop is stressed.",
    heroDetail:
      "Six detection rules monitor the field around the clock — catching dry soil before crops reach wilting point, waterlogging before root damage sets in, pipe bursts before significant water is lost, and low tank levels before the pump runs dry. Valve and pump control sit directly on the dashboard so operators can respond without leaving the monitoring view.",

      "Your existing field sensors probably already speak MQTT or HTTP, so there is nothing to replace in the field. All ten device types — soil sensors, weather stations, flow meters, valves, tank sensor, pump — connect to the same Telemetry Channel and flow through the same rules. One Zone Monitoring template scales to any number of irrigation zones without duplicating configuration. Soil health and water consumption reports go out automatically every week.",

          "Yes. The sensors do not need to speak MQTT or HTTP directly. A local gateway — an edge controller, industrial IoT gateway, or a Raspberry Pi running a small adapter — can read your sensors via their native interface and publish SenML payloads to the Telemetry Channel. Many commercial agriculture gateways support RS-485 Modbus, SDI-12, and other field bus protocols out of the box. As long as the gateway delivers correctly formatted SenML records, the detection rules and dashboards work identically to a native MQTT sensor.",

        answer:
          "Yes. The solution ships with two zones (Zone A and Zone B), but the architecture scales to any number. Each additional zone needs its own device clients, a group for access control, and connections to the Telemetry and Commands channels. The Zone Monitoring template scales automatically — assign it to any group containing devices tagged with the correct zone device tags and it renders the right data without any template changes. Detection rules apply to all telemetry in the Telemetry Channel, so new zone devices are covered by the same rules immediately after connection.",

        question:
          "How often should devices publish readings for the alarms to be effective?",
        answer:
          "Detection rules evaluate each SenML message as it arrives, so alarm latency equals the device's publish interval. For soil moisture monitoring where conditions change gradually, publishing every 5–10 minutes is adequate. For flow meter and pipe burst detection where conditions can change in seconds, publishing every 30–60 seconds gives operators a window to respond before significant water is lost. Battery reporting is not time-sensitive — once per hour is sufficient for the Low Battery Alert to be useful without generating unnecessary network traffic.",

        question:
          "Can we use the pack with drip irrigation as well as sprinkler systems?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The pack is agnostic to the irrigation delivery method. Drip and sprinkler systems both use flow meters to report `flow_rate` and `total_volume`, so the High Flow Alert, daily consumption report, and Irrigation Analytics Dashboard work the same way for both. The main difference is the normal flow rate range: a drip system running at 2–5 L/min will have a lower typical `flow_rate` than a sprinkler running at 15–22 L/min. You may want to lower the pipe burst threshold in the High Flow Alert rule to match your drip system's actual flow profile — the default of 40 L/min is calibrated for sprinkler systems.",
